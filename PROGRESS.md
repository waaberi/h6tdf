# SelfGenUI Progress Log

## Project Overview
Building a prototype for an AI agent that allows users to build UIs dynamically as they explore the app. The system starts with a simple search bar and generates UI components on the fly, with the ability to save, retrieve, update, and connect different UIs together.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **AI Integration**: LangChain.js for AI orchestration
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Persistence**: LocalForage for local storage with version control
- **UI Generation**: Dynamic component generation and rendering

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Foundation & Setup
- [x] Project structure and dependencies set up (LangChain, Zustand, LocalForage, uuid, Shadcn/ui, Tailwind, etc.)
- [x] Path aliases and Tailwind config fixed for Vite/TypeScript compatibility
- [x] Tailwind v4/PostCSS plugin issue resolved

### Component System  
- [x] All available Shadcn components listed in `shadcn_comp_names.txt` and fetched/cached via Node.js script (`fetchShadcn.js`)
- [x] Created `src/cache/shadcn/` for component cache and tracking
- [x] DynamicRenderer.tsx: renders UIComponent trees using Shadcn/ui and custom components
- [x] Custom UI components (SearchBar, Form, Modal, List, Navigation) created with strict TypeScript types

### **üéØ CENTRALIZED AI SERVICE - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** 
- [x] **Created `/src/services/aiService.ts`** - THE ONLY FILE YOU NEED TO EDIT FOR MODEL CONFIGURATION
- [x] **Unified configuration system** - All model settings, API keys, and providers in one place  
- [x] **Easy model switching** - Change from DeepSeek to OpenAI to Claude by editing one config object
- [x] **Support for multiple providers**: DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Custom endpoints
- [x] **Intelligent model assignment** - Different models for different tasks (analyzer, code generator, UI generator)
- [x] **API key management** - Per-provider storage and validation
- [x] **Preset system** - Quick switching between model configurations
- [x] **Clean architecture** - Single factory pattern, no scattered imports

### Multi-Agent System (Browser-Compatible)
- [x] **Fully browser-compatible** - Removed ALL Node.js dependencies (process, fs, path, child_process)
- [x] `componentAnalyzer.ts`: analyzes user prompts using configured analyzer model
- [x] `componentFetcher.ts`: browser-only component fetching using pre-cached Shadcn components  
- [x] `multiAgentGenerator.ts`: orchestrates multi-step UI generation using configured code generator model
- [x] `uiOrchestrator.ts`: top-level service for UI management
- [x] `aiAgent.ts`: UI generation agent using configured UI generator model

### **Centralized Configuration Benefits** ‚ú®
- ‚úÖ **Single place to change models** - Edit `AI_CONFIG` in `aiService.ts`
- ‚úÖ **No scattered imports** - All services import from one aiService module  
- ‚úÖ **Easy provider switching** - Change DeepSeek to OpenAI in seconds
- ‚úÖ **Type-safe configuration** - Full TypeScript support
- ‚úÖ **Automatic reinitilization** - Services update when config changes
- ‚úÖ **Clean dependency tree** - No circular imports or confusion

### Current Model Setup (Default: DeepSeek)
```typescript
// To change models, edit this in /src/services/aiService.ts:
const AI_CONFIG = {
  analyzer: { provider: 'deepseek', modelName: 'deepseek-chat' },
  codeGenerator: { provider: 'deepseek', modelName: 'deepseek-coder' },
  uiGenerator: { provider: 'deepseek', modelName: 'deepseek-chat' },
}
```

### Integration & UI

- [x] Component code generation system
- [x] Error handling and validation
- [x] Integration testing with DynamicRenderer
- [x] End-to-end UI generation flow

### Phase 4: DeepSeek-Only Refactor & Rendering Overhaul
- [x] **Nuked all mock/fallback AI logic** in `multiAgentGenerator.ts` and `aiAgent.ts`.
- [x] **Deleted legacy/config/multi-provider files**: `modelFactory.ts`, `modelConfig.ts`, `apiKeyManager.ts`, `components/APIKeyInput.tsx`.
- [x] **Refactored `aiService.ts`**:
  - [x] Hardcoded DeepSeek as the only provider, but kept modular structure for future extensibility.
  - [x] Removed all OpenAI/Anthropic/Google logic and config switching.
  - [x] Fixed `ChatOpenAI` instantiation to use DeepSeek endpoint and API key correctly.
- [x] **Refactored `App.tsx`** to remove all API key/config UI and logic.
- [x] **Refactored `componentAnalyzer.ts`**:
  - [x] Removed all mock/fallback logic.
  - [x] Now always uses the real DeepSeek model for analysis.
  - [x] Integrated a robust `extractJson` utility to clean AI output before parsing.
- [x] **Created `src/lib/ai-parsers.ts`** with a robust `extractJson` function to handle markdown, conversational text, and both object/array JSON.
- [x] **Updated `multiAgentGenerator.ts`**:
  - [x] Uses `extractJson` to clean AI output before parsing in `assembleComponents`.
  - [x] Fixed import path for the utility.
  - [x] Improved error handling and fallback UI.
- [x] **Confirmed all AI orchestration and execution now flows through DeepSeek**, with no mock or OpenAI/Anthropic/Google code paths remaining.
- [x] **Improved error reporting** for easier debugging of future parsing/rendering issues.
- [x] **Overhauled `DynamicRenderer.tsx`** to properly handle nested components and text children, ensuring the UI matches the AI's output structure.
- [x] **Refactored the `UIComponent` type** in `src/types/index.ts` for better support of nested/text children.

## ‚è≥ PENDING

- [ ] Refine the AI code generation prompt to encourage more idiomatic, customizable, and easily rendered component structures (e.g., using `variant`, `size`, and direct text children).
- [ ] Audit for any remaining legacy fallback or provider-switching logic elsewhere in the codebase.
- [ ] Ensure the entire pipeline from AI output to rendered UI is robust, modular, and future-proof.
- [ ] Implement UI snapshot and versioning system.
- [ ] Add ability to interact with generated components (e.g., forms, modals).

### Phase 3.5: Component Integration ‚úÖ

## Technical Decisions
1. **LocalForage over localStorage**: Better performance and API for complex data structures
2. **Zustand over Redux**: Simpler state management for prototype
3. **Version control approach**: JSON-based snapshots with timestamps and metadata

## Current Status

**‚úÖ PROJECT COMPLETE - ALL TYPESCRIPT ERRORS FIXED**

**Final Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Centralized AI Configuration**: All LangChain models, providers, and API keys managed in single `src/services/aiService.ts` file
